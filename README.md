A personal thought distiller for readers and researchers. Long ideas condensed into insights.

How do humans manage overwhelming data and retain meaningful insights?
How could we scaffold fragmented information into usable, cross-disciplinary assets?

Thought Bank is a prototypal knowledge management system to address the problem of information overload and long-term knowledge retention in a scroll-driven era.

Students, researchers, and working professionals are bombarded by endlessly long research articles daily.

Sure, Large Language Models pose as a viable solution towards collapsing redundant information into digestible chunks. But the research strongly suggests that these tools encourage cognitive ease at the cost of compromis[ing] depth in inquiry (Stadler, Bannert, & Sailer, 2024)

Modern pedagogy is, functionally, at a crossroads.

Breadth has never become so accessible and retention has never become so scarce. The classic approach of note taking is hyper-inefficient. The current alternative however â€“ memorizing articles, coordinating notes for projects between different sites has evolved into an incredibly frustrating process. I wanted a system where knowledge accrues like longitudinal data layered over time.

Currently only self-hosted using script.js and html
